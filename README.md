The app pulls info from steam and cheapshark APIs to display the games. Games can be searched by title. If a game does not exist in the app, the user can click the search button with the game title. This will prompt the app to fetch and display the game(s) matching the title in the chart, and also inserts the game(s) into the app's database.
